        <h1>Heading 1</h1>
        <p>Hopes and dreams were dashed that day. 
            It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock.warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility,<br> however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny.<br> 
            That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came crashing down</p>
        <h2> Heading 2</h2>
        <p>"Are you getting my texts???" she texted to him.<br> 
            He glanced at it and chuckled under his breath.<br> Of course he was getting them, but if he wasn't getting them, how would he ever be able to answer? <br>He put the phone down and continued on his project.<br>
             He was ignoring her texts and he planned to continue to do so.</p>
        <h3> Heading 3</h3>
        <p>
            She wondered if the note had reached him. <br>
            She scolded herself for not handing it to him in person. She trusted her friend, <br>
            but so much could happen. She waited impatiently for word.
